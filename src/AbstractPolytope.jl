    AbstractPolytope{N<:Real} <: AbstractConvexSet{N}

Abstract type for polytopic sets, i.e., sets with finitely many flat facets, or
equivalently, sets defined as an intersection of a finite number of halfspaces,
or equivalently, sets with finitely many vertices.

### Notes

Every concrete `AbstractPolytope` must define the following functions:
- `vertices_list(::AbstractPolytope{N})::Vector{Vector{N}}` -- return a list of
    all vertices

"""
    singleton_list(P::AbstractPolytope{N})::Vector{Singleton{N}} where {N<:Real}

Return the vertices of a polytopic as a list of singletons.

### Input

- `P` -- a polytopic set

### Output

List containing a singleton for each vertex.
