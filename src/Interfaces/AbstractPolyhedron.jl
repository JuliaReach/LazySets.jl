"""
    AbstractPolyhedron{N} <: ConvexSet{N}

Abstract type for closed convex polyhedral sets.

### Notes

See [`HPolyhedron`](@ref) for a standard implementation of this interface.

Every concrete `AbstractPolyhedron` must define the following functions:

- `constraints_list(::AbstractPolyhedron)` -- return a list of all facet constraints

Polyhedra are defined as the intersection of a finite number of closed
half-spaces.
As such, polyhedra are closed and convex but not necessarily bounded.
Bounded polyhedra are called *polytopes* (see [`AbstractPolytope`](@ref)).

The subtypes of `AbstractPolyhedron` (including abstract interfaces):

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LazySets: subtypes)
julia> subtypes(AbstractPolyhedron)
8-element Vector{Any}:
 AbstractPolytope
 HPolyhedron
 HalfSpace
 Hyperplane
 Line
 Line2D
 Star
 Universe
```

# supertype for all linear map algorithms
abstract type AbstractLinearMapAlgorithm end

"""
    constrained_dimensions(P::AbstractPolyhedron)

Return the indices in which a polyhedron is constrained.

### Input

- `P` -- polyhedron

### Output

A vector of ascending indices `i` such that the polyhedron is constrained in
dimension `i`.

### Examples

A 2D polyhedron with constraint ``x1 â‰¥ 0`` is constrained in dimension 1 only.
