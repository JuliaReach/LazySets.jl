# alias for set difference
import Base: \

    \\(X::LazySet, Y::LazySet)

Convenience alias for set difference.

### Input

- `X` -- a set
- `Y` -- another set

### Output

The set difference between `X` and `Y`.

### Notes

If `X` and `Y` are intervals, `X \\ Y` is used in some libraries to denote
the left division, as the example below shows. However, it should not be
confused with the *set difference*. For example,

```julia
julia> X = Interval(0, 2); Y = Interval(1, 4);

julia> X \\ Y   # computing the set difference
LazySets.Interval{Float64,IntervalArithmetic.Interval{Float64}}([0, 1])

julia> X.dat \\ Y.dat  # computing the left division
[0.5, ∞]
```

"""
    difference(I1::IN, I2::IN)::Union{EmptySet{N}, IN, UnionSet{N, IN, IN}} where {N, IN<:Interval{N}}

Return the set difference between the given intervals.

The set difference is defined as:

```math
    I₁ \\setminus I₂ = \\{x: x ∈ I₁ \\text{ and } x ∉ I₂ \\}
```

The backslash symbol, `\\`, can be used as an alias.

### Input

- `I1` -- first interval
- `I2` -- second interval

### Output

Depending on the position of the intervals, the output is one of the following:

- An `EmptySet`.
- An `Interval`.
- A `UnionSet` of two `Interval` sets.

### Algorithm

Let ``I₁ = [a, b]`` and ``I₂ = [c, d]`` be intervals. Their set difference is
``I₁ \\setminus I₂ = \\{x: x ∈ I₁ \\text{ and } x ∉ I₂ \\}`` and depending on their
position three different results may occur:

- If ``I₁`` and ``I₂`` do not overlap, i.e. if their intersection is empty, then the
  set difference is just ``I₁``.
- Otherwise, let `I₁₂ = I₁ ∩ I₂` and assume that it is not empty, then either
  ``I₁₂`` splits `I₁` into one interval or into two intervals. The latter case
  happens when the inclusion is strict on both ends of ``I₂``.

To check for strict inclusion, we assume that the inclusion is strict and then
check if the resulting intervals that cover `I₁` (one to its left and one to its
right, let them be `Ileft` and `Iright`), obtained by intersection with `I₂`,
are flat or not. Three cases may arise:

- If both `Ileft` and `Iright` are flat then it means that `I₁ = I₂`, then the
  set difference is the empty set.
- If only `Ileft` is flat, then the remaining interval not covered by `I₂` is
  `Iright`. In a similar manner, if only `Iright` is flat, then `Ileft` is returned.
- Finally, if none of the intervals is flat, then `I₂` is strictly contained in
  `I₁` and the set union of `Ileft` and `Iright` is returned.
