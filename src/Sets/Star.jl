    Star(c::VN, V::MN, P::PT) where {N, VN<:AbstractVector{N}, MN<:AbstractMatrix{N}, PT<:AbstractPolyhedron{N}}

Generalized star set with a polyhedral predicate, i.e.

```math
X = \\{x ∈ \\mathbb{R}^n : x = x₀ + \\sum_{i=1}^m α_i v_i,~~\\textrm{s.t. } P(α) = ⊤ \\},
```
where ``x₀ ∈ \\mathbb{R}^n`` is the center, the ``m`` vectors ``v₁, …, vₘ`` form
the basis of the star set, and the combination factors
``α = (α₁, …, αₘ) ∈ \\mathbb{R}^m`` are the predicates' decision variables,
i.e. ``P : α ∈ \\mathbb{R}^m → \\{⊤, ⊥\\}`` where the polyhedral predicate satisfies
``P(α) = ⊤`` if and only if ``Aα ≤ b`` for some fixed ``A ∈ \\mathbb{R}^{p × m}`` and
``b ∈ \\mathbb{R}^p``.

### Fields

- `c` -- vector that represents the center
- `V` -- matrix where each column corresponds to a basis vector
- `P` -- polyhedral set that represents the predicate

### Notes

The predicate function is implemented as a conjunction of linear constraints, i.e.
a subtype of `AbstractPolyhedron`. By a slight abuse of notation, the *predicate*
is also used to denote the subset of ``\\mathbb{R}^n`` such that ``P(α) = ⊤`` holds.

The ``m`` basis vectors (each one ``n``-dimensional) are stored as the columns
of an ``n × m`` matrix.

Internally, this function is implemented as the lazy affine map of the polyhedral
set `P`, with the transformation matrix and translation vector being `V` and `c`
respectively.

### Examples

This example is drawn from Example 1 in [2]. Consider the two-dimensional plane
``\\mathbb{R}^2``. Let

```jldoctest star_constructor
julia> V = [[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]];
```
be the basis vectors and take

```jldoctest star_constructor
julia> c = [3.0, 3.0];
```
as the center of the star set. Let the predicate be the infinity-norm ball of radius 1,

```jldoctest star_constructor
julia> P = BallInf(zeros(2), 1.0);
```
Finally, the star set ``X = ⟨c, V, P⟩`` defines the set:

```jldoctest star_constructor
julia> S = Star(c, V, P)
AffineMap{Float64,BallInf{Float64,Array{Float64,1}},Float64,Array{Float64,2},Array{Float64,1}}([1.0 0.0; 0.0 1.0], BallInf{Float64,Array{Float64,1}}([0.0, 0.0], 1.0), [3.0, 3.0])
```

We can use getter functions for each component field:

```jldoctest star_constructor
julia> center(S)
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 3.0
 3.0

julia> basis(S)
2×2 Array{Float64,2}:
 1.0  0.0
 0.0  1.0

julia> predicate(S)
BallInf{Float64,Array{Float64,1}}([0.0, 0.0], 1.0)
```
In this case, we know calculating by hand that the generalized star ``S`` is
defined by the rectangular set

```math
    T = \\{(x, y) ∈ \\mathbb{R}^2 : (2 ≤ x ≤ 4) ∧ (2 ≤ y ≤ 4) \\}
```
It holds that ``T`` and ``S`` are equivalent.
