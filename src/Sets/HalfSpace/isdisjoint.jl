    isdisjoint(H1::HalfSpace, H2::HalfSpace, [witness]::Bool=false)

### Algorithm

Two half-spaces do not intersect if and only if their normal vectors point in
the opposite direction and there is a gap between the two defining hyperplanes.

The latter can be checked as follows:
Let ``H1 : a_1⋅x = b_1`` and ``H2 : a_2⋅x = b_2``.
Then we already know that ``a_2 = -k⋅a_1`` for some positive scaling factor
``k``.
Let ``x_1`` be a point on the defining hyperplane of ``H1``.
We construct a line segment from ``x_1`` to the point ``x_2`` on the defining
hyperplane of ``hs_2`` by shooting a ray from ``x_1`` with direction ``a_1``.
Thus we look for a factor ``s`` such that ``(x_1 + s⋅a_1)⋅a_2 = b_2``.
This gives us ``s = (b_2 - x_1⋅a_2) / (-k a_1⋅a_1)``.
The gap exists if and only if ``s`` is positive.

If the normal vectors do not point in opposite directions, then the defining
hyperplanes intersect and we can produce a witness as follows.
All points ``x`` in this intersection satisfy ``a_1⋅x = b_1`` and
``a_2⋅x = b_2``. Thus we have ``(a_1 + a_2)⋅x = b_1+b_2``.
We now find a dimension where ``a_1 + a_2`` is non-zero, say, ``i``.
Then the result is a vector with one non-zero entry in dimension ``i``, defined
as ``[0, …, 0, (b_1 + b_2)/(a_1[i] + a_2[i]), 0, …, 0]``.
Such a dimension ``i`` always exists.
