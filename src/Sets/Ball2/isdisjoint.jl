    isdisjoint(B1::Ball2, B2::Ball2, [witness]::Bool=false)

### Algorithm

``B1 ∩ B2 = ∅`` iff ``‖ c_2 - c_1 ‖_2 > r_1 + r_2``.

A witness is computed depending on the smaller/bigger ball (to break ties,
choose `B1` for the smaller ball) as follows.
- If the smaller ball's center is contained in the bigger ball, we return it.
- Otherwise start in the smaller ball's center and move toward the other center
  until hitting the smaller ball's border.
  In other words, the witness is the point in the smaller ball that is closest
  to the center of the bigger ball.
