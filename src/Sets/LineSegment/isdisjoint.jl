    isdisjoint(L1::LineSegment, L2::LineSegment, [witness]::Bool=false)

### Algorithm

The algorithm is inspired from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/565282), which
itself is the special 2D case of a 3D algorithm from [Goldman90](@citet).

We first check if the two line segments are parallel, and if so, if they are
collinear. In the latter case, we check membership of any of the end points in
the other line segment. Otherwise the lines are not parallel, so we can solve an
equation of the intersection point, if it exists.
