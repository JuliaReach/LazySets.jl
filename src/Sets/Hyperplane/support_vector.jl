    σ(d::AbstractVector, H::Hyperplane)

### Output

A support vector in the given direction, which is only defined in the following
two cases:
1. The direction has norm zero.
2. The direction is the hyperplane's normal direction or its opposite direction.
In all cases, any point on the hyperplane is a solution.
Otherwise this function throws an error.

```

Return a support vector of a hyperplane ``a⋅x = b`` in direction `d`.

### Input

- `d`         -- direction
- `a`         -- normal direction
- `b`         -- constraint
- `error_unbounded` -- (optional, default: `true`) `true` if an error should be
                 thrown whenever the set is unbounded in the given direction
- `halfspace` -- (optional, default: `false`) `true` if the support vector
                 should be computed for a half-space

### Output

A pair `(v, f)` where `v` is a vector and `f` is a Boolean flag.

The flag `f` is `false` in one of the following cases:
1. The direction has norm zero.
2. The direction is (a multiple of) the hyperplane's normal direction.
3. The direction is (a multiple of) the opposite of the hyperplane's normal
direction and `halfspace` is `false`.
In all these cases, `v` is any point on the hyperplane.

Otherwise, the flag `f` is `true`, the set is unbounded in the given direction,
and `v` is any vector.

If `error_unbounded` is `true` and the set is unbounded in the given direction,
this function throws an error instead of returning.

### Notes

For correctness, consider the
[weak duality of LPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Duality):
If the primal is unbounded, then the dual is infeasible.
Since there is only a single constraint, the feasible set of the dual problem is
``a ⋅ y == d``, ``y ≥ 0`` (with objective function ``b ⋅ y``).
It is easy to see that this problem is infeasible whenever ``a`` is not parallel
to ``d``.
