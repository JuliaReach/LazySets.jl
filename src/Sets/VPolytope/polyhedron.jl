        Return a `VRep` polyhedron from `Polyhedra.jl` given a polytope in vertex
        representation.

        ### Input

        - `P`       -- polytope in vertex representation
        - `backend` -- (optional, default: `default_polyhedra_backend(P)`) the
                       backend for polyhedral computations; see [Polyhedra's
                       documentation](https://juliapolyhedra.github.io/) for further
                       information
        - `relative_dimension` -- (default, optional: `nothing`) an integer representing
                                  the (relative) dimension of the polytope; this
                                  argument is mandatory if the polytope is empty

        ### Output

        A `VRep` polyhedron.

        ### Notes

        The *relative dimension* (or just *dimension*) refers to the dimension of the
        set relative to itself, independently of the ambient dimension. For example, a
        point has (relative) dimension zero, and a line segment has (relative) dimension
        one.

        In this library, `LazySets.dim` always returns the ambient dimension of the set,
        such that a line segment in two dimensions has dimension two. However,
        `Polyhedra.dim` will assign a dimension equal to one to a line segment
        because it uses a different convention.
