Typically, the list of blocks should form a partition of the set 1 dots n represented as a list of consecutive blocks, where n is the ambient dimension of set S.\n\nHowever, technically there is no problem if the blocks are not consecutive, blocks are missing, blocks occur more than once, or blocks are overlapping. This function will, however, stick to the order of blocks, so the resulting set must be interpreted with care in such cases. One use case is the need of a projection consisting of several blocks.\n\nFor convenience, the argument block_options can also be given as a single option instead of a mapping, which is then interpreted as the option for all blocks.\n\nExamples\n\nThis function supports different options: one can specify the target set, the degree of accuracy, and template directions. These options are exemplified below, where we use the following example.\n\njulia> using LazySets.Approximations: decompose\n\njulia> S = Ball2(zeros(4), 1.);  # set to be decomposed (4D 2-norm unit ball)\n\njulia> P2d = [1:2, 3:4];  # a partition with two blocks of size two\n\njulia> P1d = [[1], [2], [3], [4]];  # a partition with four blocks of size one\n\nDifferent set types\n\nWe can decompose using polygons in constraint representation:\n\njulia> all([ai isa HPolygon for ai in array(decompose(S, P2d, HPolygon))])\ntrue\n\nFor decomposition into 1D subspaces, we can use Interval:\n\njulia> all([ai isa Interval for ai in array(decompose(S, P1d, Interval))])\ntrue\n\nHowever, if you need to specify different set types for different blocks, the interface presented so far does not apply. See the paragraph Advanced input for different block approximations below for how to do that.\n\nRefining the decomposition I:  ε-close approximation\n\nThe ε option can be used to refine a decomposition, i.e., obtain a more accurate result. We use the Iterative refinement algorithm from the Approximations module.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider again the set S from above. We decompose into two 2D polygons. Using smaller ε implies a better precision, thus more constraints in each 2D decomposition. In the following example, we look at the number of constraints in the first block.\n\njulia> d(ε, bi) = array(decompose(S, P2d, (HPolygon => ε)))[bi]\nd (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> [length(constraints_list(d(ε, 1))) for ε in [Inf, 0.1, 0.01]]\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  4\n  8\n 32\n\nRefining the decomposition II: template polyhedra\n\nAnother way to refine a decomposition is by using template polyhedra. The idea is to specify a set of template directions and then to compute on each block the polytopic overapproximation obtained by evaluating the support function of the given input set over the template directions.\n\nFor example, octagonal 2D approximations of the set S are obtained with:\n\njulia> using LazySets.Approximations: OctDirections\n\njulia> B = decompose(S, P2d, OctDirections);\n\njulia> length(B.array) == 2 && all(dim(bi) == 2 for bi in B.array)\ntrue\n\nSee Template directions for the available template directions. Note that, in contrast to the polygonal ε-close approximation from above, this method can be applied to blocks of any size.\n\njulia> B = decompose(S, [1:4], OctDirections);\n\njulia> length(B.array) == 1 && dim(B.array[1]) == 4\ntrue\n\nAdvanced input for different block approximations\n\nInstead of defining the approximation option uniformly for each block, we can define different approximations for different blocks. The third argument has to be a mapping from block index (in the partition) to the corresponding approximation option.\n\nFor example:\n\njulia> res = array(decompose(S, P2d, Dict(1 => Hyperrectangle, 2 => 0.1)));\n\njulia> typeof(res[1]), typeof(res[2])\n(Hyperrectangle{Float64,Array{Float64,1},Array{Float64,1}}, HPolygon{Float64})\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/approximations/#LazySets.Approximations.project","page":"Approximations","title":"LazySets.Approximations.project","text":"project(S::LazySet{N},\n        block::AbstractVector{Int},\n        set_type::Type{<:LinearMap},\n        [n]::Int=dim(S)\n       )::LinearMap{N} where {N<:Real}\n\nProject a high-dimensional set to a given block by using a lazy linear map.\n\nInput\n\nS         – set\nblock     – block structure - a vector with the dimensions of interest\nLinearMap – used for dispatch\nn         – (optional, default: dim(S)) ambient dimension of the set S\n\nOutput\n\nA lazy LinearMap representing a projection of the set S to block block.\n\n\n\n\n\nproject(S::LazySet{N},\n        block::AbstractVector{Int},\n        set_type::Type{<:LazySet},\n        [n]::Int=dim(S)\n       ) where {N<:Real}\n\nProject a high-dimensional set to a given block and set type, possibly involving an overapproximation.\n\nInput\n\nS        – set\nblock    – block structure - a vector with the dimensions of interest\nset_type – target set type\nn        – (optional, default: dim(S)) ambient dimension of the set S\n\nOutput\n\nA set of type set_type representing an overapproximation of the projection of S.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nProject the set S with M⋅S, where M is the identity matrix in the block\n\ncoordinates and zero otherwise.\n\nOverapproximate the projected lazy set using overapproximate and\n\nset_type.\n\n\n\n\n\nproject(S::LazySet{N},\n        block::AbstractVector{Int},\n        set_type_and_precision::Pair{<:UnionAll, <:Real},\n        [n]::Int=dim(S)\n       ) where {N<:Real}\n\nProject a high-dimensional set to a given block and set type with a certified error bound.\n\nInput\n\nS     – set\nblock – block structure - a vector with the dimensions of interest\nset_type_and_precision – pair (T, ε) of a target set type T and an                             error bound ε for approximation\nn     – (optional, default: dim(S)) ambient dimension of the set S\n\nOutput\n\nA set representing the epsilon-close approximation of the projection of S.\n\nNotes\n\nCurrently we only support HPolygon as set type, which implies that the set must be two-dimensional.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nProject the set S with M⋅S, where M is the identity matrix in the block\n\ncoordinates and zero otherwise.\n\nOverapproximate the projected lazy set with the given error bound ε.\n\n\n\n\n\nproject(S::LazySet{N},\n        block::AbstractVector{Int},\n        ε::Real,\n        [n]::Int=dim(S)\n       ) where {N<:Real}\n\nProject a high-dimensional set to a given block and set type with a certified error bound.\n\nInput\n\nS     – set\nblock – block structure - a vector with the dimensions of interest\nε     – error bound for approximation\nn     – (optional, default: dim(S)) ambient dimension of the set S\n\nOutput\n\nA set representing the epsilon-close approximation of the projection of S.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nProject the set S with M⋅S, where M is the identity matrix in the block\n\ncoordinates and zero otherwise.\n\nOverapproximate the projected lazy set with the given error bound ε.\n\nThe target set type is chosen automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nproject(S::LazySet{N},\n        block::AbstractVector{Int},\n        directions::Type{<:AbstractDirections},\n        [n]::Int\n       ) where {N<:Real}\n\nProject a high-dimensional set to a given block using template directions.\n\nInput\n\nS          – set\nblock      – block structure - a vector with the dimensions of interest\ndirections – template directions\nn          – (optional, default: dim(S)) ambient dimension of the set S\n\nOutput\n\nThe template direction approximation of the projection of S.\n\n\n\n\n\nproject(H::HalfSpace{N}, block::AbstractVector{Int})\n\nConcrete projection of a half-space.\n\nInput\n\nH        – set\nblock    – block structure, a vector with the dimensions of interest\n\nOutput\n\nA set representing the projection of the half-space H on the dimensions specified by block.\n\nNotes\n\nCurrently only the case where the unconstrained dimensions of H are a subset of the block variables is implemented.\n\nExamples\n\nConsider the half-space x + y + 0z  1, whose ambient dimension is 3.

The convex hull of two zonotopes Z₁ and Z₂ of the same order, which we write\n\nZ_j = c^(j) g^(j)_1  g^(j)_p\n\nfor j = 1 2, can be overapproximated as follows:\n\nCH(Z_1 Z_2)  frac12c^(1)+c^(2) g^(1)_1+g^(2)_1 \ng^(1)_p+g^(2)_p c^(1)-c^(2) g^(1)_1-g^(2)_1  g^(1)_p-g^(2)_p\n\nIf the zonotope order is not the same, this algorithm calls reduce_order to reduce the order to the minimum of the arguments.\n\nIt should be noted that the output zonotope is not necessarily the minimal enclosing zonotope, which is in general expensive in high dimensions. This is further investigated in [2].\n\n'join' method\n\nIf algorithm == \"join\", we choose the method proposed in [3, Definition 1]. The convex hull X of two zonotopes Z₁ and Z₂ is overapproximated by a zonotope Z₃ such that the box approximation of X is identical with the box approximation of Z₃. Let (X) denote the box approximation of X. The center of Z₃ is the center of (X).\n\nThe generator construction consists of two phases. In the first phase, we construct generators g as a combination of one generator from Z₁, say, g₁, with another generator from Z₂, say, g₂. The entry of g in the i-th dimension is given as\n\n    gi = argmin_min(g₁i g₂i)  x  max(g₁i g₂i) x\n\nIf g is the zero vector, it can be omitted.\n\nIn the second phase, we construct another generator for each dimension. These generators are scaled unit vectors. The following formula defines the sum of all those generators.\n\n    sup((X)) - c - _g g\n\nwhere c is the center of the new zonotope and the gs are the generators constructed in the first phase.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Reachability of Uncertain Linear Systems Using Zonotopes, A.

It is mutable and setting the value of a field affects the getter functions hence it can be used to fix the tolerance globally in LazySets.\n\nDefault values are defined for the most commonly used numeric types, and for those cases when other numeric types are needed one can extend the default values as explained next.\n\nThe cases Float64 and Rational are special in the sense that they are the most commonly used types in applications. Getting and setting default tolerances is achieved with the functions _rtol and set_rtol (and similarly for the other tolerances); the implementation creates an instance of Tolerance{Float64} (resp. Tolerance{Rational}) and sets some default values. Again since Tolerance is mutable, setting a value is possible e.g. set_rtol(Type{Float64}, ε) for some floating-point ε.\n\nFor all other cases, a dictionary mapping numeric types to instances of Tolerance for that numeric type is used. For floating-point types, a default value has been defined through default_tolerance as follows:\n\ndefault_tolerance(N::Type{<:AbstractFloat}) = Tolerance(Base.rtoldefault(N), sqrt(eps(N)), zero(N))\n\nHence to set a single tolerance (either rtol, ztol or atol) for a given floating-point type, use the corresponding set_rtol function, while the values which have not been set will be pulled from default_tolerance. If you would like to define the three default values at once, or are computing with a non floating-point numeric type, you can just extend default_tolerance(N::Type{<:Number}).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/comparisons/#Approximate-inequality-1","page":"Comparisons","title":"Approximate inequality","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/comparisons/#","page":"Comparisons","title":"Comparisons","text":"_leq(x::N, y::N; kwargs...) where {N<:Real}\n_leq(x::N, y::M; kwargs...) where {N<:Real, M<:Real}\n_geq(x::Real, y::Real; kwargs...)\n_leq(x::N, y::N; rtol::Real=Base.rtoldefault(N), ztol::Real=ABSZTOL(N), atol::Real=zero(N)) where {N<:AbstractFloat}","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/comparisons/#LazySets._leq-Union{Tuple{N}, Tuple{N,N}} where N<:Real","page":"Comparisons","title":"LazySets._leq","text":"_leq(x::N, y::N; [kwargs...]) where {N<:Real}\n\nDetermine if x is smaller than or equal to y.\n\nInput\n\nx      – number\ny      – another number (of the same numeric type as x)\nkwargs – not used\n\nOutput\n\nA boolean that is true iff x <= y.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nThis is a fallback implementation for numbers of type Real.

Le Guernic. Reachability Analysis of Hybrid Systems with Linear Continuous Dynamics, PhD thesis.\n\nIn the original algorithm, Section 8.2 of Le Guernic's thesis, the linear map is performed concretely and the intersection is performed lazily (these are the default options in this algorithm, but here the four combinations are available). If the set X is a zonotope, its concrete projection is again a zonotope (sometimes called \"zonogon\"). The intersection between this zonogon and the line can be taken efficiently in a lazy way (see Section 8.2.2 of Le Guernic's thesis), if one uses dispatch on ρ(y_dir, Sℓ⋂Lγ; kwargs...) given that Sℓ is itself a zonotope.\n\nNotes\n\nThis function depends itself on the calculation of the support function of another set in two dimensions. Obviously one doesn't want to use again algorithm=\"projection\" for this second calculation. The option algorithm_2d_intersection is such that, if it is not given, the default support function algorithm is used (e.g. \"line_search\"). You can still pass additional arguments to the \"line_search\" backend through the kwargs.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/operations/#LazySets.linear_map-Union{Tuple{N}, Tuple{AbstractArray{N,2},Intersection{N,S1,S2} where S2<:LazySet{N} where S1<:LazySet{N}}} where N","page":"Common Set Operations","title":"LazySets.linear_map","text":"linear_map(M::AbstractMatrix{N}, cap::Intersection{N}) where {N}\n\nReturn the concrete linear map of a lazy intersection.\n\nInput\n\nM   – matrix\ncap – lazy intersection\n\nOutput\n\nThe set obtained by applying the given linear map to the lazy intersection.\n\nNotes\n\nThis function relies on computing cap concretely (i.e. as a set representation), and then applying the linear map.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/operations/#LazySets.plot_recipe-Union{Tuple{Intersection{N,S1,S2} where S2<:LazySet{N} where S1<:LazySet{N}}, Tuple{N}, Tuple{Intersection{N,S1,S2} where S2<:LazySet{N} where S1<:LazySet{N},N}, Tuple{Intersection{N,S1,S2} where S2<:LazySet{N} where S1<:LazySet{N},N,Int64}} where N<:Real","page":"Common Set Operations","title":"LazySets.plot_recipe","text":"plot_recipe(cap::Intersection{N}, [ε]::N=-one(N),\n            [Nφ]::Int=PLOT_POLAR_DIRECTIONS) where {N<:Real}\n\nConvert a lazy intersection to a pair (x, y) of points for plotting.\n\nInput\n\ncap  – lazy intersection\nε    – (optional, default 0) ignored, used for dispatch\nNφ   – (optional, default: PLOT_POLAR_DIRECTIONS) number of polar           directions used in the template overapproximation\n\nOutput\n\nA pair (x, y) of points that can be plotted.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/operations/#RecipesBase.apply_recipe-Union{Tuple{N}, Tuple{Dict{Symbol,Any},Intersection{N,S1,S2} where S2<:LazySet{N} where S1<:LazySet{N}}, Tuple{Dict{Symbol,Any},Intersection{N,S1,S2} where S2<:LazySet{N} where S1<:LazySet{N},N}, Tuple{Dict{Symbol,Any},Intersection{N,S1,S2} where S2<:LazySet{N} where S1<:LazySet{N},N,Int64}} where N<:Real","page":"Common Set Operations","title":"RecipesBase.apply_recipe","text":"plot_intersection(cap::Intersection{N}, [ε]::N=zero(N),\n                  [Nφ]::Int=PLOT_POLAR_DIRECTIONS) where {N<:Real}\n\nPlot a lazy intersection.\n\nInput\n\ncap  – lazy intersection\nε    – (optional, default 0) ignored, used for dispatch\nNφ   – (optional, default: PLOT_POLAR_DIRECTIONS) number of polar           directions used in the template overapproximation\n\nNotes\n\nThis function is separated from the main LazySet plot recipe because iterative refinement is not available for lazy intersections (since it uses the support vector (but see #1187)).\n\nAlso note that if the set is a nested intersection, you may have to manually overapproximate this set before plotting (see LazySets.Approximations.overapproximate for details).\n\nExamples\n\njulia> using LazySets.Approximations\n\njulia> X = Ball2(zeros(2), 1.) ∩ Ball2(ones(2), 1.5);  # lazy intersection\n\njulia> plot(X)\n\nYou can specify the accuracy of the overapproximation of the lazy intersection by passing a higher value for Nφ, which stands for the number of polar directions used in the overapproximation.

Then we already know that a_2 = -ka_1 for some positive scaling factor k. Let x_1 be a point on the defining hyperplane of hs_1. We construct a line segment from x_1 to the point x_2 on the defining hyperplane of hs_2 by shooting a ray from x_1 with direction a_1. Thus we look for a factor s such that (x_1 + sa_1)a_2 = b_2. This gives us s = (b_2 - x_1a_2)  (-k a_1a_1). The gap exists if and only if s is positive.\n\nIf the normal vectors do not point in opposite directions, then the defining hyperplanes intersect and we can produce a witness as follows. All points x in this intersection satisfy a_1x = b_1 and a_2x = b_2. Thus we have (a_1 + a_2)x = b_1+b_2. We now find a dimension where a_1 + a_2 is non-zero, say, i.

See the Algorithm section below for details about the structure.\n\nNotes\n\nThe restriction to polyhedral sets in cpa only applies to the blocks that are actually intersected with P (see the Algorithm section below for details). All other blocks are not considered by the intersection and remain identical.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nThe underlying idea of the algorithm is to exploit the unconstrained dimensions of P. Without loss of generality, assume that cpa has the structure X  Y  Z such that only the dimensions of Y are constrained in P, and denoting a suitable projection of P to the dimensions of Y with P_Y, we have the following equivalence:\n\n    (X  Y  Z)  P = X  (Y  P_Y)  Z\n\nNote that Y may still consist of many blocks. However, due to the structural restriction of a Cartesian product, we cannot break down this set further even if P_Y is still unconstrained in some dimensions of blocks in Y. This would require a restructuring of the dimensions. Consider this example:\n\n    Y = 0 1  1 2  2 3\n    P_Y = x₁ + x₃  2\n    Y  P_Y = 0  x₁  1  x₂  2  2  x₃  x₁ + x₃  2\n\nEven though the constraints of dimension x₂ are decoupled from the rest, due to the last constraint the Cartesian product cannot be broken down further. In particular, the result Y  P_Y is a polyhedron in this implementation.\n\nNow we explain the implementation of the above idea. We first identify the dimensions in which P is constrained. Then we identify the block dimensions of X  Y  Z such that Y has minimal dimension. Finally, we convert Y to a polyhedron and intersect it with a suitable projection of P.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/binary_functions/#Minkowski-sum-1","page":"Binary Functions on Sets","title":"Minkowski sum","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/binary_functions/#","page":"Binary Functions on Sets","title":"Binary Functions on Sets","text":"minkowski_sum(::LazySet{N}, ::LazySet{N}) where {N<:Real}\nminkowski_sum(::AbstractPolyhedron{N}, ::AbstractPolyhedron{N}) where {N<:Real}\nminkowski_sum(::VPolytope{N}, ::VPolytope{N}) where {N<:Real}\nminkowski_sum(::AbstractHyperrectangle{N}, ::AbstractHyperrectangle{N}) where {N<:Real}\nminkowski_sum(::AbstractZonotope{N}, ::AbstractZonotope{N}) where {N<:Real}\nminkowski_sum(::VPolygon{N}, ::VPolygon{N}) where {N<:Real}\nminkowski_sum(::PolynomialZonotope, ::Zonotope)","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/binary_functions/#LazySets.minkowski_sum-Union{Tuple{N}, Tuple{LazySet{N},LazySet{N}}} where N<:Real","page":"Binary Functions on Sets","title":"LazySets.minkowski_sum","text":"minkowski_sum(P::LazySet{N}, Q::LazySet{N};\n              [backend]=nothing,\n              [algorithm]=nothing,\n              [prune]=true) where {N<:Real}\n\nConcrete Minkowski sum for a pair of lazy sets using their constraint representation.\n\nInput\n\nP         – lazy set\nQ         – another lazy set\nbackend   – (optional, default: nothing) polyhedral computations backend\nalgorithm – (optional, default: nothing) algorithm to compute the elimination                of variables; available options are Polyhedra.FourierMotzkin,                Polyhedra.BlockElimination, and Polyhedra.ProjectGenerators\nprune     – (optional, default: true) if true, apply a post-processing algorithm                to remove redundant constraints\n\nOutput\n\nAn HPolytope that corresponds to the Minkowski sum of P and Q if both P and Q are bounded; otherwise an HPolyhedron.\n\nNotes\n\nThis function requires that the list of constraints of both lazy sets P and Q can be obtained.

The idea is that if we write P and Q in simple H-representation, that is, P = x  mathbbR^n  Ax  b  and Q = x  mathbbR^n  Cx  d , then their Minkowski sum can be seen as the projection onto the first n-dimensional coordinates of the polyhedron\n\n    beginpmatrix 0  A  C  -C endpmatrix binomxy  inombd\n\nThis is seen by noting that P  Q corresponds to the set of points x  mathbbR^n such that x = y + z with Ay  b and Cz  d; hence it follows that Ay  b and C(x-y)  d, and the inequality displayed above follows by considering the 2n-dimensional space binomxy. The reduction from 2n to n variables is performed using an elimination algorithm as described next.\n\nThe elimination of variables depends on the concrete polyhedra library Polyhedra, which itself uses CDDLib for variable elimination.

We also compute the number of vertices that we have to create.\n\nNext we create the vertices. We do this by enumerating all vectors v of length n (the dimension of H) with entries -1/0/1 and construct the corresponding vertex as follows:\n\n    textvertex(v)(i) = begincases c(i) + r(i)  v(i) = 1 \n                                          c(i)  v(i) = 0 \n                                          c(i) - r(i)  v(i) = -1 endcases\n\nFor enumerating the vectors v, we modify the current v from left to right by changing entries -1 to 1, skipping entries 0, and stopping at the first entry 1 (but changing it to -1). This way we only need to change the vertex in those dimensions where v has changed, which usually is a smaller number than n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/interfaces/#LazySets.constraints_list-Union{Tuple{AbstractHyperrectangle{N}}, Tuple{N}} where N<:Real","page":"Set Interfaces","title":"LazySets.constraints_list","text":"constraints_list(H::AbstractHyperrectangle{N}) where {N<:Real}\n\nReturn the list of constraints of an axis-aligned hyperrectangular set.\n\nInput\n\nH – hyperrectangular set\n\nOutput\n\nA list of linear constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/interfaces/#LazySets.high-Union{Tuple{AbstractHyperrectangle{N}}, Tuple{N}} where N<:Real","page":"Set Interfaces","title":"LazySets.high","text":"high(H::AbstractHyperrectangle{N})::Vector{N} where {N<:Real}\n\nReturn the higher coordinates of a hyperrectangular set.\n\nInput\n\nH – hyperrectangular set\n\nOutput\n\nA vector with the higher coordinates of the hyperrectangular set.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/interfaces/#LazySets.high-Union{Tuple{N}, Tuple{AbstractHyperrectangle{N},Int64}} where N<:Real","page":"Set Interfaces","title":"LazySets.high","text":"high(H::AbstractHyperrectangle{N}, i::Int)::N where {N<:Real}\n\nReturn the higher coordinate of a hyperrectangular set in a given dimension.\n\nInput\n\nH – hyperrectangular set\ni – dimension of interest\n\nOutput\n\nThe higher coordinate of the hyperrectangular set in the given dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/interfaces/#LazySets.low-Union{Tuple{AbstractHyperrectangle{N}}, Tuple{N}} where N<:Real","page":"Set Interfaces","title":"LazySets.low","text":"low(H::AbstractHyperrectangle{N})::Vector{N} where {N<:Real}\n\nReturn the lower coordinates of a hyperrectangular set.\n\nInput\n\nH – hyperrectangular set\n\nOutput\n\nA vector with the lower coordinates of the hyperrectangular set.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/interfaces/#LazySets.low-Union{Tuple{N}, Tuple{AbstractHyperrectangle{N},Int64}} where N<:Real","page":"Set Interfaces","title":"LazySets.low","text":"low(H::AbstractHyperrectangle{N}, i::Int)::N where {N<:Real}\n\nReturn the lower coordinate of a hyperrectangular set in a given dimension.\n\nInput\n\nH – hyperrectangular set\ni – dimension of interest\n\nOutput\n\nThe lower coordinate of the hyperrectangular set in the given dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"lib/interfaces/#LazySets.isflat-Tuple{AbstractHyperrectangle}","page":"Set Interfaces","title":"LazySets.isflat","text":"isflat(H::AbstractHyperrectangle)::Bool\n\nDetermine whether a hyperrectangular set is flat, i.e. whether its radius is zero in some dimension.\n\nInput\n\nH – hyperrectangular set\n\nOutput\n\ntrue iff the hyperrectangular set is flat.\n\nNotes\n\nFor robustness with respect to floating-point inputs, this function relies on the result of isapproxzero when applied to the radius in some dimension.
